# Documentaion

This documentation is built using a framework called "Vitepress". With the help of Vitepress, we have a beautyful and very fluid application, without writing a single line of code.

The pages and texts are defined in easiliy readable text-files, so called ".md" files - "Markdown".

Therefore, everybody is able to contribute to the documentation and to the vision.

The files for this documentation are located in the following GitHub repository:

https://github.com/ever-mira/trippy-build

Changes to the files are automatically deployed to this site - the documentation you are currently reading.

It is meant to be, that everybody is able to contribute to the documentation - in terms of technology, but also in terms of vision.

The documentation should be a place, where the vision of the project can be described, and a place that describes how the project and its participants are organized.

It should be a place to look up important information, but also a place to inspire and invite other people to participate in building something new and beautyful.
